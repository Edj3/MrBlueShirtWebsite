						<h1>Played by Michael Stewart</h1>
						<br/>
						<p>Mike loves being in front of the camera as much as being behind it as no doubt he is the "bell cow", so you will a heavy dose of Mike to no one's surprise in the Mr. Blue Shirt movies. before on-camera acting, he began with haunted house acting in the late 1990's as a young boy, then in 2002 at age 16 he got his first camcorder and has not looked back since that time. Mike studied at Northampton Community College and Kutztown Univeristy where he met many people who have helped bring Mr. Blue Shirt to life in the early test films of 2008 and 2010 and then with the regular MBS films. Mike hopes the different acting philosophies, funky editing style, and the strange dialogue brings about a huge fanbase to the fans of movies around the country... and who knows maybe even the world.</p>
						</br>
						<p>Blue is the supposed savior or messiah figure in the land of Ogidni. He does not exactly understand his purpose in the beginning, but as time rolls by; it becomes more clear: he is the main protagonist of Ogidni and Earth.</p>

						<h1>Played by Ben Lewis</h1>
						<br/>
						<p>Ben Lewis has been into acting and music since a very young age. Ben met Mike in 2004 at Northampton Community College and they made a short together on gay rights called, "Taste the Rainbow." Ben is one of the few lone survivors from the early test films of Mr. Blue Shirt during the years of 2007-2010 to make it to the modern day and "real Mr. Blue Shirt" movies as Mike Stewart so calls them.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Violet is the serious and no-jokes kind of a personality Shirt. In his time in Ogidni, he is blessed by King Haran to be the leader of the Shirts in the expedition to find Mr. Blue Shirt.</p>

						<h1>Played by Chris Piatt</h1>
						<br/>
						<p>Chris is an actor on the rise from the Lehigh Valley, so be on the lookout!! He has recenty been in two indy horror features, which were Beaster Day: Here Comes Peter Cottonhell (2014) and Arisen (2015). Now in the role of the super-envious Mr. Green Shirt, things will only look up from here!</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Green is the most unenthusiastic of the group. He could care less about whatever mission at hand and just gets jealous of any asset in good light that he does not have, but some other character does have. Its a curse that he needs to learn to get over with and fight his demons for the sake of the Milky Way Galaxy during the great Story-Teller vs. Earth War.</p>

						<h1>Played by Genoveva Rossi</h1>
						<br/>
						<p>Genoveva Rossi is a cult film star and well-known horror genre actress. She has always been a huge fan of acting. As a child she loved to play dress up and act out different scenes from her favorite movies. Her favorite genres to act in are: horror, comedy, drama, and improv.</p>
						<br/>
						<p>Also, Genoveva has always been a huge fan of horror and the supernatural, so her transition into acting in the horror genre was very natural for her. She is mostly known for her horror films, but has branched out a quite bit in her selection of roles. She's played a sexy Satanist, a séance leader, a demon, a pregnant hippie, a mother, a hired assassin, a murderer, a witch, a fortune-teller, a doctor at a mental asylum, a reporter, a zombie, a vampire, a member of the National Guard, a sexy model, and a whole bunch more. So far it's been an exciting ride and a fabulous opportunity to challenge herself as an actress and to expand her horizons as an adventurer. Genoveva loves the excitement of trying on a new character and really getting inside that person's head.</p>
						</br>
						</br>
						<p>Like Mr. Black Shirt, she is very in tune with the dead and anything of gothic nature.</p>
						</br>
						<p>The curse of Cyan is of thuggish and unusual tongue of non-normal language and behavior. It's pretty gangster and rude, the curse that is, to whatever character she might come across. A plan to unravel the union gathering of all of the Female Forbidden Shirts comes into place after the creation of those Shirts, which includes Mrs. Cyan Shirt meeting a very important character during her imprisonment.</p>

Zeromon has a powerful wizard staff and mild telekinesis ability. He enjoys some fresh whiskey and cooked rat meats, not to mention an enthusiasts of potions and spells.</p>

						<br/>
						<p>Its not like your normal Jesus that you may have seen in your normal type of films. This Jesus has a modern day personality and is aware of all Earth events that have transpired since he first came into this world. "Its a dramatic interpretation in a wild and crazy film, which is one of the cool chemical blends you could say," says producer/director Mike Stewart</p>
